# Concrete-Crack-Detection
 This project has 2 objectives. The first is to select a convolutional neural network by comparing pre-trained models. The second is to create a simple GUI application to check if an image has concrete crack or not.

 concretecrackdetector.py is scripted to run using tkinter with a simple GUI.

 deploy.py is a script to run the model on the local machine using Gradio to deploy the model.

 train.py is the python script used to train the model and save it locally.

 model_compare is a jupyter notebook. The jupyter notebook file was scripted in google colab to train and compare multiple models to see which has the most accurate predictions.
